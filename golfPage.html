			<p>This page will describe different types of golf clubs and when you would choose that club.</p>

			<h2>Driver</h2>
			<img src="drivers.jpg" height="200" width="300" alt="drivers">
				<p>The driver is probably the first club you'll use, and you <em>drive</em> the ball with it. Your goal is to hit the ball as close to the green as possible, and drivers are used to smack it down the fairway.</p>

		<h2>Woods</h2>
		<img src="woods.jpg" height="200" width="300" alt="woods">
		<p>Woods have longer shafts and rounder and larger heads than the other golf clubs. They are used to hit the ball far distances. They used to be made of wood, but now are usually made of metal. Woods are numbered starting with the driver, or 1-wood, which has the lowest loft. The numbers go up with progressively higher lofts. Many hybrid clubs fall under this category.</p>

		<h2>Irons</h2>
		<img src="irons.jpg" height="200" width="300" alt="irons">
		<p>Irons in golf usually contain between 3 to 9 clubs, and including wedges. Irons with higher loft than the numbered irons are called wedges, and are usually used for specialty shots or high launch angles.</p>

		<p>Irons from 2-4 are long irons. They have low loft and long shafts. They are designed to hit the ball far with low angles. Mid irons are 5-7, and are easier to hit than long irons. Irons 8 and 9 are short irons. They have the shortest shaft and are used for shots requiring high loft or short distance.</p>

		<h2>Putter</h2>
		<img src="putters.jpg" height="200" width="375" alt="putters">
		<br>
		<p>The putter is what you use once your golfball reaches the green, or the smooth area next to the flag and hole. The putter has a very flat face, and a golfer would be in a lot of trouble if they didn't have this specialized club with them at the course.</p>

		<p>There are different variations such as:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Long-shaft putters</li>
				<li>Fetch Mallet</li>
				<li>Insert Faced Putters</li>
			</ul>
		<p>Head over to a local sports store to try different putters to see which one works best for you. What might work great for your golfing buddy might not feel natural to you!</p>
